# Flight Cancellation Prediction

This project focuses on predicting flight cancellations in U.S. domestic air traffic using machine learning models. The goal is to help airlines optimize their operations by predicting cancellations and improving customer experience. The models are evaluated using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to determine the best predictor for flight cancellations.

## Features

- **Flight Data Analysis**: Process and analyze flight data to extract meaningful features.
- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate models using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Visualization**: Visualize model performance and compare the results.
